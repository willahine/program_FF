                            Introduction
                        </h2>
                      <p>Tunisia is at the forefront of a struggle against jihadi-salafi violence that has intensified since 2011. In the first two years after the revolution that ended decades of authoritarian rule under Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, Tunisian jihadi-salafists saw Tunisia largely as a “land of da`wa,” or spiritual outreach. Rather than confront the state directly, they recruited adherents through social activism and encouraged young Tunisians to join the expanding fight against the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria, which rallied would-be jihadi-salafi fighters and revolutionaries from around the world. Yet, Tunisia could not isolate itself from the gathering violence in the region. By 2013, a slew of attacks against military forces along the country’s western border and two high-profile political assassinations in the capital thrust Tunisia into a new phase of escalating and expanding confrontation. In the words of jihadi-salafists, Tunisia had become a “land of jihad.”</p>

                      <blockquote>An estimated 6,000–7,000 young Tunisians have left home to fight in Syria and Iraq as well as in Libya with al Qaeda-linked groups and the Islamic State group (ISG) since 2011.</blockquote>

                      <p>An estimated 6,000–7,000 young Tunisians have left home to fight in Syria and Iraq as well as in Libya with al Qaeda-linked groups and the Islamic State group (ISG) since 2011. Tunisians are one of the largest groups of foreign nationals among the estimated 40,000 or more foreign fighters who have joined jihadi groups in Syria and Iraq alone and the several thousand more who are believed to have enlisted in Libya. It is striking that so many militants have emerged from a country of 11 million people which represents less than 1 percent of the world’s Muslim population and which stood at the forefront of the Arab uprisings.</p>

                      <p>As thousands of Tunisians went off to fight in foreign lands, others stayed home. Dozens of young Tunisians have committed terrorist attacks inside their country, killing scores of civilians and security personnel. Since 2013, the government has reportedly prevented thousands more from traveling outside Tunisia to join radical groups and jailed hundreds more in widespread arrests.</p>

                      <p>The extent of violence in Tunisia and the sheer numbers of young Tunisians lured toward jihadi-salafi groups in Syria and Libya have alarmed and confounded many Tunisians and outside observers. The susceptibility of so many young Tunisians to radical ideology and violence poses difficult questions: Why has a country with such hope for positive change and representative government produced one of the largest groups of jihadi-salafi fighters? Why has a relatively small Arab country that has seemingly been on the margins of the Middle East and North Africa played such an outsized role in perpetuating jihadi-salafi violence? Why has Tunisia been so vulnerable to terrorism?</p>

                        <blockquote>Why has a country with such hope for positive change and representative government produced one of the largest groups of jihadi-salafi fighters?</blockquote>

                      <p>There are no simple answers to these questions. Instead, a host of complex domestic and international factors have intersected to create physical and intellectual space for radical ideology and activity to grow and evolve across the country. The threat has expanded amid the uncertainties of a vulnerable moment in Tunisia’s political transition and history. Although religious ideologies of jihadi-salafism have inspired some Tunisian recruits, and undergird the armed groups which have drawn the vast majority of Tunisian fighters, a narrow focus on religion obscures the complex sets of motives that radicalize youth.  Jihadi-salafi narratives have become the language through which a subset of disaffected Tunisians express frustrations that point to deeper ills facing the country. The remedies, like the affliction, resist concise answers.</p>

                      <p><strong>This interactive microsite tells the story of how and why thousands of young Tunisians joined jihadi-salafi groups after the 2011 uprisings.</strong> It examines how successive Tunisian governments continue battling an evolving knot of threats, while also grappling with the historic task of building a legitimate and representative government after decades of dictatorship.</p>

                      <p>This story traces the past and the present evolution of Tunisia’s encounter with modern jihadi-salafi violence. It tracks the beginning of modern Tunisian jihadi-salafism in the 1980s from the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan to the attacks of September 11, 2001, its revival after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, and its unprecedented expansion after the 2011 uprisings. It probes the diversity of this new generation of recruits, their motivations, and their roles in jihadi-salafi groups, especially the Islamic State group and al Qaeda- affiliated groups. It explores how Tunisia’s domestic context after the revolution created the conditions for radicalism to grow, and the policy fronts on which the government is now battling the threat.</p>

                      <p><strong>Interactive maps illustrate patterns in the violence that has rattled Tunisia and the paths that Tunisians take to foreign battlefields.</strong> The first map series tracks major terrorist attacks in Tunisia and shows how terrorism and political violence have evolved year by year, beginning with the watershed year of 2013. A second map series depicts common routes that Tunisian recruits travel to reach conflict zones in Syria and Libya. Biographies of selected fighters recount the stories of individual Tunisians from diverse backgrounds who have joined jihadi-salafi groups abroad.</p>

                      <p>What follows is a sketch of Tunisia’s journey in its struggle against radicalism. It is not intended as a complete record or catalogue of violent incidents inside Tunisia since 2011 or an exhaustive account of Tunisian foreign fighters in Syria and Libya.  It aims to provide an understanding of the multiple security threats Tunisia faces and answer the question of why the country has been so vulnerable to radicalism. It examines the religious dimension of jihadi-salafi recruitment and violence as one piece of a larger story about the many unanswered questions facing Tunisian youth. </p>


<p>Although each country’s encounter with jihadi-salafi violence is unique, Tunisia’s experience holds important lessons for what has become a generational and global challenge. </p>
